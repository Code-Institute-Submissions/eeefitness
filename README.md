<h2 align="center">Code Institute - Milestone Project 1</h2>

<img src="documentation/eeefitness-responsive-screenshot-wider.png" />

EEE Fitness is a fictitious gym whose motto is Exercise Energize Empower. 
This project is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute, and the main requirements were to make a static but responsive website with a minimum of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

### User Centred Design
#### 1)	Strategy plane:
The main goal of the website is to attract new members to sign up to the gym or to enquire about becoming members. The website follows the Business to Consumer model and is aimed at a fitness conscious audience. It should include minimal, relevant, content and lots of imagery of people working out using state-of-the-art gym equipment. 

I started the UX process by creating the User Stories above which helped me work out who the project was aimed at and what I would need to include in the website to satisfy the needs of the users.

#### 2)	Scope plane:
The key features of the website were developed based on user needs. 

Users should be able to do the following on the website:
- Find out information about the gym’s: 
  * location
  * opening times
  * price plans
  * services
  * facilities
  * classes
- Sign up to become a member
- Learn about the benefits of being a member
- View testimonials
- Contact the gym with a question
- Visit the gym’s social media channels
- Learn more about the gym and its ethos

#### 3)	Structure plane:

After looking at the needs of the site's users and after visiting many gym websites I grouped the features into four main pages: ‘Home’, ‘About, ‘Membership’ and ‘Contact’. 


I wanted to make sure the nav bar was always easy to view in order to help users navigate through the site, therefore I thought about creating a fixed nav, however for the mobile and tablet view I opted for the smaller, neater ‘hamburger’ icon and dropdown menu to keep the screen less cluttered.

#### 4)	Skeleton plane:

I was at this stage ready to put together wireframes. I used Balsamiq for these, creating wireframes for each page on desktop, tablet and mobile.

I aimed to make sure the main content areas were expressed in similar ways, to create consistency.  A ‘hero image’, title and motivational heading has been included at the top of each page for consistency.

## Features

The project consists of different pages, all of which can be accessed through the menu in the navigation bar.

#### Consistent features across all pages:
- The fixed navigation bar containing the menu at the top of the page is consistent across all pages, however it has been condensed into a drop-down menu on tablet and mobile devices in order to streamline the appearance.
- The footer containing contact details and social media icons is consistent across all pages.

#### Features to be implemented in the future:
- An online booking system for classes that current gym members can access through the website.
- A payment system so that people can buy their membership package immediately from the site.
- A link to TrustPilot or a similar consumer review website where the gym’s current members can share their positive experiences at EEE Fitness.

#### 5.	Surface Plane

### Design Choices
The highest percentage of gym-going users in Ireland in 2019 were in the 25 to 34 year-old age category .  This cohort of society are mobile savvy and therefore a mobile-first approach was taken, helped by the use of the Bootstrap framework. These young professionals have disposable income and I imagine that they are looking for a professional gym that achieves results.
People in this age category are likely to be busy, working, commuting, socialising, family commitments, therefore time is a precious commodity to them. Because of this I want the site to be easy to navigate with key information intuitively located. 

#### Typography
After reading the ilovewp.com article ‘Most Used Google Fonts on Gym Websites’ I chose the most popular option of Open Sans as my main font.  For the second font I went with Google Fonts’ suggested complimentary font, Roboto, which was the third most popular font for gym websites.   

#### Icons
Icons may be used alongside the text within the site in order to help the user to understand the content at a glance. They will be taken from Font Awesome and chosen to be self explanatory.

#### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was chose on the basis that I wanted a simple, clean and visually appealing site that evoked both an energetic, clean and professional atmosphere. Orange is colour that is traditionally associated with energy.  White is a colour associated with cleanliness.  Grey is a colour associated with business and professionalism. 

<center><img src="documentation/eee-fitness-colour-palette.png" height="300" width="600" /></center>

- For the navigation bar I will be using #2D3142, Space Cadet, which a relatively dark, professional looking grey.  As most gym equipment is grey in colour, shades of grey appeared to be appropriate for the functional navigational bar and the footer.
- The background colour of site will be #FAFAFA, Cultured, a subtle white colour, to keep the website’s image clean and to provide easy contrast.
- When a user scrolls over navigation links the shade of white will change to #FB5607, Orange Pantone, to indicate to the user which link they will be pressing.  To be consistent the social media links in the footer will also change from white to orange when hovered over.
- #FC7536, Orange Crayola, will be used as an accent colour throughout the site, from the logo to horizontal lines between sections, to call-to-action buttons.
- #D3D3D3, Light Grey, will be used as a background colour and text colour for certain sections in order to provide a softer contrast from preceding/subsequent sections which use the Cultured white colour. 
- Text colour throughout the site will be either Cultured, Light Grey or Space Cadet, depending on which is easier for the user to read against the assigned background colour of the element in question.

## Development
After looking at my wireframes and README.md my mentor, Reuben Ferrante suggested that I look at more efficient layout for the About page as it would result in an unpleasant user experience for the mobile user.  Taking my mentor’s advice on board I looked at either including Tabs or a Dashboard.  I also looked at including a dropdown menu from the About item with three separate pages for Services, Facilities and Classes.  Again, this seemed to require more clicks and a less pleasant experience for the user. Therefore I opted to include information about the gym staff and services on the Home page and create six main pages: Home, Facilities, Classes, Membership, Contact and Sign Up.  This structure should allow the end user to access the information that they seek with fewer clicks, hopefully leading the user toward continuing the browsing experience.

My mentor also helpfully showed me how to embed a Google Map in order to allow visitors to the site to locate the gym more easily.  Initially this was included soley in the Footer section of the desktop view, however when it came to building the site it was also added to the footer when viewed on a tablet.  This decision was taken partly for aesthetic reasons and partly because it was pointed out to me that many tablet users use their device as a replacement for a desktop computer and therefore expect much of the functionality of the desktop view when browsing online.

## Testing.
Chrome Developer Tools were used extensively throughout the development process in order to test whether elements were responsive when viewed on mobile and tablet devices. When problems were encountered the Device Selector was used to target the element.  Using the Elements Panel in Developer Tools the code in question was altered in order to achieve the desired result. 
Working code snippets were then replicated in the style.css file in Gitpod. Other solutions for errors were found in the Code Institute Slack channels, on Stac.  

W3C HTML Validator was used to validate the code. It highlighted some errors across the site which have since been recitified: button tags used within anchor tags, 
At the moment the website has been tested on Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera & Mozilla Firefox. The website works and functions as expected on Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Opera.  When opened in Firefox, however the custom svg bullet points do not always render.  
This is a known issue. I have decided to leave it for now and detail it in the README as the only current error I have come across on the project.

## Browsers Tested
- Chrome Version 85.0.4183.121 (Official Build) (64-bit)
